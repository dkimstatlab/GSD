# GSD : R package for Graph Signal Decomposition

## Description
Graph signals residing on the vertices of a graph have recently gained prominence in research in various fields. Many methodologies have been proposed to analyze graph signals by adapting classical signal processing tools. Recently, several notable graph signal decomposition methods have been proposed, which include graph Fourier decomposition based on graph Fourier transform, graph empirical mode decomposition, and statistical graph empirical mode decomposition. This package efficiently implements multiscale analysis applicable to various fields, and offers an effective tool for visualizing and decomposing graph signals.
